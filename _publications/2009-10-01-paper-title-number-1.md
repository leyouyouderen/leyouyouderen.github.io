excerpt: 'We propose a novel integrated Gaussian Process-Bayesian Bernoulli Mixture model (GP-B2M) and a principled sampling function for multi-label classification active learning. The proposed method could accurately quantify a data sample's overall contribution to a correlated label space and choose the most informative samples for cost-effective annotation.'
