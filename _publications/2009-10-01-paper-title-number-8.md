excerpt: 'Medical diagnosis requires extensive knowledge of pathological characteristics and the clinical training necessary to master specific domains. In the domain of dermatology, these properties include the size, shape, distribution, color, and location of symptoms. We have built and trained a tag recommender with expert narratives of dermatological disease, then explored the effectiveness of this system on novice narratives. The system mitigates the prerequisite of domain knowledge, empowering a novice to enhance their medical descriptions or even reach an accurate diagnosis. After collecting novice narratives, we explored word alignment to provide a mapping between expert and novice vocabulary allowing novice input to be augmented with expert terminology. Ultimately, we found that our system is an effective educational tool, which could be improved by word alignment and other techniques.'
