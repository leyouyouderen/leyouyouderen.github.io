excerpt: 'The high cost for labeling data instances is a key
bottleneck for training effective supervised learning models.
This is especially the case in domains such as medicine and
bioinformatics, where expert knowledge is required for understanding and extracting the underlying semantics of data. Active
learning provides a means to reduce human labeling efforts by
identifying the most informative data instances. In this paper,
we propose a cost-effective active learning framework to further
lessen human efforts, especially in knowledge-rich domains where
a large number of classes may be subject to scrutiny during
decision making. In particular, this framework employs a novel
many-class sampling model, MC-S, for data sample selection.
MC-S is further augmented with convex hull-based sampling to
achieve faster convergence of active learning. Evaluation studies
conducted over multiple real-world datasets with many classes
demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces
the overall labeling efforts through fast convergence and early
stop of active learning.'
