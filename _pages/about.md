I am a Ph.D student at [Machine Learning and Data-intensive Computing Lab](https://www.rit.edu/mining/) at Rochester Institute of Technology, mentored by Professor [Qi Yu](https://www.rit.edu/directory/qyuvks-qi-yu).

My research focuses on [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)), a special human-in-the-loop machine learning principle that leverages human expertsâ€™ knowledge for efficient and economic training. Active learning is useful especially for knowledge-rich domains such as bioinformatics, military and medical. In those domains, we often find that the labeled data are limited, and annotating the unlabeled data requires domain experts who are difficult to find and expensive to hire.
