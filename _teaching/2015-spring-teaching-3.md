There is mounting evidence of a need to improve the ability of individuals and groups to think
thoughtfully and analytically in order to develop appropriate and useful solutions to complex
problems. Sources of complexity include human cognitive limitations, uncertainty, system
dynamics, and reasoning errors. This course will provide students with frameworks,
techniques, methods, and tools to improve analytical and critical thinking and presentation
skills. Students will work individually and in groups on assignments and case study analyses.
